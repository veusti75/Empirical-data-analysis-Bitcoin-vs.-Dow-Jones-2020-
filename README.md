# Empirical-data-analysis-Bitcoin-vs.-Dow-Jones-2020-

In this document, the data analysed is taken from US stock markets.
We select daily data from the US stock markets, taking selected stocks
as well as crypto currency, for the year 2020. Our benchmark for
the US market will be the Dow Jones. We will discuss our trading
strategy and then test it and analyse the results. Then applying it to
several big tech companies that we carefully chose after the statistical
study of our data will allow us to predict the latter. It is further
assumed that the types of trends and the direction of future price
movements can be represented statistically. These assumptions are
tested on historical DJIA (Dow) data and confirmed. In addition, it is
statistically demonstrated that a number of trends that have occurred
in the near past close to the Dow can be used to predict the near future
of the index. We will therefore proceed in this way on our data, after
extracting them and ensuring their quality. We will study the research
models, and come out with the best fitting strategy joining two world
of assets.
